# EU-PDF-Docs-Report

This analysis was carried out to understand the detailed content of the European Union report on 2023 Nigerian election.
I wanted to find out the contents of the PDF report of European Union observation mission (EUOM) having generated so much hashtags,
retweets, likes and comments on social media since its release on the 23rd of June, 2023. 

The EUOM monitored the Nigeria election before, during and after election (1 January- 16th March, 2023),
then released a 94 page detailed report of the activities of the general election on the 23rd of June, 2023. 

Rstudio was used for the analysis.

libraries used are pdftools, tidytext



Thank you
